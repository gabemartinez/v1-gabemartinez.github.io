About

My name is Gabriel Martinez. I'm a software engineer that currently specializes in web development.

I'm also a fan of many sports teams. Is there anything else that goes together as well as sports and technology?

Currently, I'm working at [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/) developing [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) web applications and [custom modules](https://github.com/gabemartinez). Before that, I worked for a [company](http://teaminfographics.info/) that develops data visualizations for sports entities. I was responsible for the implementation of the system and framework encompassing the functionality used to create the graphics.

My educational background and work experience can be found on my always updated [LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/martinezg).

In my spare time I continue to learn new techniques and technologies surrounding software development. Lately I've been working with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and many things [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and others. I also publish projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/gabemartinez/).

This blog will detail experiences I have with coding, application development, work, projects, and computer issues.

But, you might see some other things on here too.

Feel free to contact me via the social media links in the header.

Thanks for visiting.
