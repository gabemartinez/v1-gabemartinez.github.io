About

My name is Gabriel Martinez. I'm a software engineer. Some of my professional interests include developing web applications and building impactful software solutions.

I'm also a fan of many sports teams.

Currently, I'm working with a company that develops data visualizations for sports entities. I am responsible for the implementation of the software system and framework encompassing the functionality used to create the visualizations.

Please view examples of our work <a href="http://twitter.com/teaminfographs">here</a>.

My educational background and work experience can be found on my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/martinezg">linkedin profile</a>.

This blog will detail experiences I have with coding, application developing, work, projects, and computer issues. But, you might see some other things on here too.

Thanks for visiting.
