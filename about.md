About

My name is Gabriel Martinez and I'm a problem solver. Well, I'm a software engineer but I like to take credit for being a problem solver. I am interested in developing web applications and building impactful software solutions.

Currently, I'm working with a team to develop data visualization software for sports entities. Please view examples <a href="http://twitter.com/teaminfographs">here</a>.

My educational background and work experience can be found on my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/martinezg">linkedin profile</a>.

This blog will detail experiences I have with coding, developing and work. But, you might see some other things on here too. Thanks for visiting.
