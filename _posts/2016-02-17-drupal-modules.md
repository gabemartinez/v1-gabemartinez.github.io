title: An Important List of Drupal Modules
---

When beginning a Drupal project, one of the first things you might do is create a list of specifications and possibly functionality that your application needs. Those specs can determine which modules you can leverage and use; furthermore, these modules can be adapted to fit your needs if they do not already fulfill them completely.

The list of important Drupal modules that I seem to use often:

* [Features](https://www.drupal.org/project/features)
* [Views](https://www.drupal.org/project/views)
* [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs)
* [Panels](https://www.drupal.org/project/panels)
* [Chaos Tools](https://www.drupal.org/project/ctools)
* [Panopoly](https://www.drupal.org/project/panopoly)
* [Panelizer](https://www.drupal.org/project/panelizer)
* [Webform](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform)
* [Rules](https://www.drupal.org/project/rules)
* [Diff](https://www.drupal.org/project/diff)
* [Workbench](https://www.drupal.org/project/workbench)
* [Quick Tabs](https://www.drupal.org/project/quicktabs)
* [Field Collection](https://www.drupal.org/project/field_collection)
* [Feeds](https://www.drupal.org/project/feeds)

I will maintain this post as more modules work their way into my toolbox, as there are a few that I left out. Thanks for reading.
