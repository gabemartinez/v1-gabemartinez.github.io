title: Day Before Thanksgiving
---

I have so much to give thanks for this year; I didn't even write an updated blog post to detail where I'm currently working and discuss the year that was 2015 for me professionally.

Still planning to get something up soon that talks about what I'm learning, and using now primarily in my web development world.

Until then, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinezg) page as I've kept that updated.

Talk to you soon. Happy Thanksgiving.
