title: MacBook Fan Control
---

My previous post outlined a few upgrades I made to my MacBook. One thing that I noticed was that my fan was running very high and continuously.

I tried a few things like dusting my machine with an air can, and a few other things that Apple recommended but none of them seemed to work. My fan was still running constantly at a high rpm (6000+). And it did not matter what applications I had running.

My suspicion, and through other blog reading, lead me to believe that the upgrades I recently made were making my logic board think it was hotter than it was. This was causing my fan to continuously run at a high rpm.

Ok, so these are the applications I downloaded and used to control my fan speed:

* <a href="http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/">iStat Menus</a>
* <a href="http://www.eidac.de/">smcFanControl</a>
* <a href="http://www.crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control">Macs Fan Control</a>

Macs Fan Control was the ultimate winner in the fan control war that worked for my system. But, that might not be the case for you.

iStat Menus is a great application for monitoring your system temperatures, and CPU usage, but it would not override my Mac's default fan settings.

smcFanControl worked for a bit, but also failed to override my system's default fan settings.

Macs Fan Control ultimately took control of my system's default settings and allowed me to set the speed that I desired my fan to be running at. It's very easy to use, too.
