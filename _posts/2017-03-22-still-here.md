title: It's Been So Long
---

I feel terrible in neglecting this space. I’m still alive, I just haven’t gotten myself up for writing. Besides normal work I have been in graduate school and that is keeping me occupied.

Lately I’m working mostly with the following: Drupal, Salesforce, Node, and React/other JS libraries specifically. Besides that, I have been trying to stay on my fitness goals. Not overeating, and just detoxing. I joined my family recently in celebrating my grandmother’s 80th birthday. Love her.

Stay tuned for more soon. Sorry. I mean it this time. Promise. I hope. Yes. I will. Yes. Ok? Cool.

Change is good. Life in this world is constant change.
