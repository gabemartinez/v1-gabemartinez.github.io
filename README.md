# Repo Details

This repo contains files for my personal website which you can visit at [martinezgabriel.com](http://martinezgabriel.com) and is proudly hosted here at [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/).

The website was developed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and the [Using Type](https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type/) theme.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is great for static websites and blogs.

## So what is Jekyll, exactly?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown), and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.
